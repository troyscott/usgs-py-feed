usgs-py-feed
------------

This is a project demonstartes how to use Python's Bottle Micro Web Framework.  The application converts  USGS RSS Feeds to a RESTful request.  The data is then returned to the client as a JSON string.   Bottle is a standalone development server but it can be easily implmented on Google App Engine,  Tornado and other WSGI frameworks.

Plan to create a simple interface for the project using jQuery and jQuery Mobile.  The pub directory has an index.html page which makes an ajax call to  the one of the services.
